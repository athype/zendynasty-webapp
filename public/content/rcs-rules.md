# 1. The Reddit Clan System

We are a community of fun, active clans, each with our own leadership, game play focus, and direction. We have competitive, all-TH16 war clans, farm war clans, social clans that war casually, chill clans that don’t war at all, clans for lower TH development, large family clans, small independent clans, and so many more.

We offer every member of every RCS clan access to our discord, our community-wide events, contests, and giveaways, and an opportunity to be a part of a large, well-organized alliance for clashers. We offer leaders a dedicated discord channel for sharing, support, chats and inter-clan exchanges.

If you’d like to join us in an RCS clan, please take a look at our verified RCS clan list below. Confirm you meet the requirements of the clan you’d like to join, and follow the directions in Section 3 “How to Join a Verified Clan.”

# Clan Leader Agreement

All leaders of RCS clans must enforce and abide by our following rules. Failure will result in penalties up to and including the nullification of your verification.

1. You will be fair, mature, and honest in all actions and interactions with your clan members and with the RCS.
2. You will work to foster and maintain a Reddit Clan that is positive, helpful, and active, that enforces Fair Play, and is free from bullying, harassment or discrimination.
3. Your clan will display the RCS badge, and require the Reddit password as found in wiki before accepting any join requests.
4. You will maintain open communications with the RCS, join and respond to messages in the leader's chat on the RCS discord.
5. You will either maintain your own discord server, or have a shared server available to facilitate communications within your clan. In the event you require assistance, we can help. Many of our RCS servers were set up in-house. You will also offer the RCS discord to your members.
6. You will endeavor to maintain a healthy and functional clan of at least 35 active members. If you encounter difficulties for an extended period, you agree to accept help from the RCS Council in resolving matters before they deteriorate. You may, of course, reach out at any time for assistance from RCS.
7. If you are no longer able to lead effectively, you agree to step down and promote a willing and able candidate who will abide by our Clan Leader Agreement. You will introduce your successor to the RCS Council before the transfer of leadership is complete.
8. If you decide to retire or step down from leadership but do not have an intended successor, you will reach out to the Council before deciding to dispose of the clan.
9. We, the RCS, will provide a positive, helpful and active environment for all members of all Reddit Clans and offer opportunities for participation in the larger community. Members will have access to our RCS wide chats, events, promotions and resources. We will do our best to work with you to help you run your clan and maintain it to whatever extent you request and we are able. We welcome all RCS leaders and their clan members to reach out to the whole of RCS at any time.
